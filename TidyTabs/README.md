#Tidy Tabs for Sublime Text 2

Ever get to the end (middle?) of a day of coding only to find your window littered with tabs that are nearly impossible to search through visually? Find yourself rage-quitting all your tabs in disgust and starting over? No? Just me? Ok.

With this plugin, a simple keystroke `ctrl + alt + w` will close all tabs whose file has not been modified in the last 30 minutes. It will only close tabs in the background â€“ so files that are open and active in your window won't be closed. Likewise, it will not close files with unsaved changes.
